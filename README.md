# ALX simple_shell
A simple_shell project

**Description**
A project to code a simple shell for Holberton School. The project is to replicate the basic functionality of a Linux shell to test our knowledge of the C programming language. There were restrictions placed on which C standard library functions we were allowed to use. 
So, many functions were recreated for use inside the code. Standard functions and system calls employed in simple_shell include: access, execve, exit, fork, free, fstat, getline, malloc, perror, signal, stat, wait, write.
